## Optimizing-Store-Operations-using-Facial-Recognition

Developed an attendance system to efficiently manage employee schedules. Implemented a personalized customer experience where facial recognition technology identifies customers upon entry and presents tailored product recommendations and exclusive discounts. Designed and deployed a website to facilitate the integration of these features.

There were two files involved, one being the GPU for the attendance system and the second one is for the product recommendations. The link for the recommendation notebook - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inAfOItxk0F_JfTnA98pJH28IOG02rne/view?usp=sharing
